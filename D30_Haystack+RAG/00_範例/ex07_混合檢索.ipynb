Theophylline decreased the incidence of apnea (P less than .05), increased respiratory minute volume (P less than 0.001), decreased (PACO2 (and PaCO2 P less than 0.001), increased the slope of the CO2 response curve (P less than 0.02) with a significant shift to the left (P less than 0.02).

The event is unexpected, although a minor respiratory infection is common, and occurs during sleep, between 1 and 6 months of age. There is growing evidence that the victims have had previous hypoxic episodes. Although suffocation is no longer considered a tenable explanation, other forms of airway obstruction are still postulated by many; the evidence, however, favors hypoxia as the common feature. A lethal arrhythmia had been proposed by several groups, based on inappropriate reflex activity, \"pathology\" of the conduction system, and the long QT syndrome, but the evidence is against arrhythmia as the primary event in most cases of SIDS. Based on the reversible \"near miss,\" apnea is likely as the primary event in SIDS. Several reflexes have the ability to produce apnea, in addition to the relatively common sleep apnea; the crucial aspect, rather, appears to be thefailure of the immature infant to resume respiration. The possibility exists that the infant, who did not have to breather for 9 months of fetal life, literally is not alarmed and aroused by the persistance of apnea. In human and animal studies, respiratory infections and sleep deprivation have been proved to increase the likelihood and duration of sleep apnea. If primary apnea continues for long (45 seconds or more), a dangerous positive feedback develops into hypoxic apnea. Hhis will persist until circulatory failure occurs, or until gasping occurs. The gasp is a highly effective mechanism at birth, but will occur too late for autoresuscitation after the anerobic capacity of fetal life dimineshes; we believe this capacity lasts for approximately 1 month, accounting for the hiatus of crib death, sparing the first month. The \"near-miss\" infant, after resuscitation, should be monitored at home, if practical, until 6 months of age. A simple cardiac monitor for bradycardia has definite advantage over an apnea monitor alone.', 'pmid': 'PMID:16476', 'source_id': 'a268cbc45c5e530b99452b80aec18db0890fd9239cdee74dd5d6e28dc1bc46ea', 'page_number': 1}, score: 0.8215421438217163, embedding: vector of size 384),\n",

The distal trachea was cannulated to provide a free airway and the proximal end used to introduce fluids into the laryngeal area. Introduction of either water or milk produced apnea, bradycardia, and hypertension. Swab application of test fluids to the laryngeal epithelium produced similar responses. The reflex could be interrupted by flushing the laryngeal region with saline, by cutting the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN) or by anesthetizing the laryngeal epithelium with lidocaine. Electrical stimulation of SLN elicited identical responses. Respiratory inhibition by the reflex was enhanced following central depression with chloralose and overridden by administration of the respiratory stimulant, aminophylline. The relative potency of the laryngeal reflex was estimated to be equivalent to about 40% of the dose of chloralose which produced permanent respiratory arrest.

All measurements were made immediately before and within five minutes of application or any change in level of CPAP. Ventilation was derived from a pneumotachograph and dynamic compliance calculated. We have also measured arterial pH, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure. Arterial oxygen tension increased in association with a decrease in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. No consistent changes occurred in pH or carbon dioxide tension. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure remained the same but the arterial pulse pressure narrowed and the increase in central venous pressure averaged 17% of the applied airway pressure. There were less variations in both tidal volumes and instantaneous respiratory rates with CPAP compared with spontaneous breathing without CPAP. The respiratory rate decreased, but there were no consistent changes in tidal volume, resulting in a lesser reduction of minute ventilation. Dynamic compliance decreased on CPAP. With correct use of CPAP, and improvement in oxygenation generally occurs without obvious adverse cardiorespiratory effects. CPAP must nevertheless be used cautiously and in conjunction with close monitoring; because when the appropriate pressures are exceeded, it is possible that both circulatory and ventilatory function might be severely compromised.', 'pmid': 'PMID:12647', 'source_id': 'c7f830d6776cc3df79b2bba271075136525faabd29a8d24fa59ce075682c37a5', 'page_number': 1}, score: 0.1226453185081482),\n",

Before apnea, mean PaCO2 was 33 mm Hg. In seven subjects who did not breathe for 10 minutes, the mean rate of rise of PaCO2 was 3.2 mm Hg per minute. PaCO2 at 4 minutes was 50 mm Hg and at 10 minutes was 67 mm Hg. Three subjects breathed, two after less than 2 minutes of apnea, when PaCO2 was 47 and 54 mm Hg, and one after 4.5 minutes, when PaCO2 was 47 mm Hg. These data indicate: (1) that the threshold for respiratory stimulation may approach a PaCO2 of 60 mm Hg in patients with brain damage; (2) that the rate of increase in PaCO2 is such that, even in a normocapnic subject after 3 minutes of apnea, the PaCO2 may not be sufficiently high to stimulate respiration; and (3) if a patient is hypocapnic prior to the onset of apnea, PaCO2 may not reach 60 mm Hg even after 15 minutes. To confirm absolute apnea, then, blood gas monitoring is necessary for verification of normocapnia prior to the beginning of apnea.

Normal subjects are divided into two groups of a hundred (6 to 19 1/2 years of age; 20 to 59 1/2 years of age). The PECO2 at rest is higher among the young subjects than among the adults, and its decline during hyperpnea is sharper. Thus, children show discrete respiratory acidosis in comparison with adults. The EEG of normal adults is practically unchanged during hyperpnea whereas, in the young group, moderate changes in the profile were observed in 45 out of 100 cases (classified empirically as normal). The PECO2 reaches a lower level in subjects showing EEG changes than in those showing none. All the reported differences are statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The probability of hyperpnea modifying the EEG profile becomes progressively less with age, and may be related to the reduced production of CO2 in older subjects. Epileptic subjects (primary generalized epilepsy) produce more CO2 than normal subjects during the hyperpnea test. The statistical data reported in the study show the importance of the size of the drop in ventilatory CO2 in the determination of EEG changes. The rest of hyperpnea in EEG can therefore be validly interpreted only if capnographic variations are measured. A standard quantitative hyperpnea test of this type should be devised, with specification of the hypocapnia level to be achieved.', 'pmid': 'PMID:26161', 'source_id': '54831235aff2d4e091510984d772dc45fb8f4a9b954ca7743d61bbb0f4a5b9f9', 'page_number': 1}, score: 0.10985119640827179),\n",

Theophylline decreased the incidence of apnea (P less than .05), increased respiratory minute volume (P less than 0.001), decreased (PACO2 (and PaCO2 P less than 0.001), increased the slope of the CO2 response curve (P less than 0.02) with a significant shift to the left (P less than 0.02).

      "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is diagnosed by the absence of lethal autopsy findings, or in a resuscitatable, \"near miss\" form with cyanosis, apnea, and bradycardia.

There is growing evidence that the victims have had previous hypoxic episodes. Although suffocation is no longer considered a tenable explanation, other forms of airway obstruction are still postulated by many; the evidence, however, favors hypoxia as the common feature. A lethal arrhythmia had been proposed by several groups, based on inappropriate reflex activity, \"pathology\" of the conduction system, and the long QT syndrome, but the evidence is against arrhythmia as the primary event in most cases of SIDS. Based on the reversible \"near miss,\" apnea is likely as the primary event in SIDS. Several reflexes have the ability to produce apnea, in addition to the relatively common sleep apnea; the crucial aspect, rather, appears to be thefailure of the immature infant to resume respiration. The possibility exists that the infant, who did not have to breather for 9 months of fetal life, literally is not alarmed and aroused by the persistance of apnea. In human and animal studies, respiratory infections and sleep deprivation have been proved to increase the likelihood and duration of sleep apnea. If primary apnea continues for long (45 seconds or more), a dangerous positive feedback develops into hypoxic apnea. Hhis will persist until circulatory failure occurs, or until gasping occurs. The gasp is a highly effective mechanism at birth, but will occur too late for autoresuscitation after the anerobic capacity of fetal life dimineshes; we believe this capacity lasts for approximately 1 month, accounting for the hiatus of crib death, sparing the first month.

      "Cardiorespiratory reflex responses to laryngeal chemoreceptor stimulation were studied in 62 piglets of both sexes varying in age from 1 to 79 days. The distal trachea was cannulated to provide a free airway and the proximal end used to introduce fluids into the laryngeal area. Introduction of either water or milk produced apnea, bradycardia, and hypertension. Swab application of test fluids to the laryngeal epithelium produced similar responses. The reflex could be interrupted by flushing the laryngeal region with saline, by cutting the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN) or by anesthetizing the laryngeal epithelium with lidocaine. Electrical stimulation of SLN elicited identical responses. Respiratory inhibition by the reflex was enhanced following central depression with chloralose and overridden by administration of the respiratory stimulant, aminophylline. The relative potency of the laryngeal reflex was estimated to be equivalent to about 40% of the dose of chloralose which produced permanent respiratory arrest. It is concluded that in circumstances where respiratory drive is reduced the laryngeal inhibitory reflex is capable of caused persistent apnea and asphyxial death in the young piglet.\n",

      "A method of investigating the cardiorespiratory responses to continuous positive airway presslre (CPAP) in infants with respiratory distress syndrome is described. All measurements were made immediately before and within five minutes of application or any change in level of CPAP. Ventilation was derived from a pneumotachograph and dynamic compliance calculated. We have also measured arterial pH, oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, arterial blood pressure and central venous pressure. Arterial oxygen tension increased in association with a decrease in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient. No consistent changes occurred in pH or carbon dioxide tension. Heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure remained the same but the arterial pulse pressure narrowed and the increase in central venous pressure averaged 17% of the applied airway pressure. There were less variations in both tidal volumes and instantaneous respiratory rates with CPAP compared with spontaneous breathing without CPAP. The respiratory rate decreased, but there were no consistent changes in tidal volume, resulting in a lesser reduction of minute ventilation. Dynamic compliance decreased on CPAP. With correct use of CPAP, and improvement in oxygenation generally occurs without obvious adverse cardiorespiratory effects. CPAP must nevertheless be used cautiously and in conjunction with close monitoring; because when the appropriate pressures are exceeded, it is possible that both circulatory and ventilatory function might be severely compromised.\n",

      "To determine the duration of respiratory arrest needed to attain a PaCO2 level high enough to provide maximal stimulation of respiration, we evaluated changes in PaCO2, PaO2 and apH during periods of apnea lasting as long as 10 minutes in 10 apparently brain-dead subjects. Before apnea, mean PaCO2 was 33 mm Hg. In seven subjects who did not breathe for 10 minutes, the mean rate of rise of PaCO2 was 3.2 mm Hg per minute. PaCO2 at 4 minutes was 50 mm Hg and at 10 minutes was 67 mm Hg. Three subjects breathed, two after less than 2 minutes of apnea, when PaCO2 was 47 and 54 mm Hg, and one after 4.5 minutes, when PaCO2 was 47 mm Hg. These data indicate: (1) that the threshold for respiratory stimulation may approach a PaCO2 of 60 mm Hg in patients with brain damage; (2) that the rate of increase in PaCO2 is such that, even in a normocapnic subject after 3 minutes of apnea, the PaCO2 may not be sufficiently high to stimulate respiration; and (3) if a patient is hypocapnic prior to the onset of apnea, PaCO2 may not reach 60 mm Hg even after 15 minutes. To confirm absolute apnea, then, blood gas monitoring is necessary for verification of normocapnia prior to the beginning of apnea. In the absence of blood gas determinations, no fixed period of apnea, sufficient in all cases to establish absolute apnea, can be ascertained.\n",

The PECO2 reaches a lower level in subjects showing EEG changes than in those showing none. All the reported differences are statistically significant (p less than 0.01). The probability of hyperpnea modifying the EEG profile becomes progressively less with age, and may be related to the reduced production of CO2 in older subjects. Epileptic subjects (primary generalized epilepsy) produce more CO2 than normal subjects during the hyperpnea test. The statistical data reported in the study show the importance of the size of the drop in ventilatory CO2 in the determination of EEG changes. The rest of hyperpnea in EEG can therefore be validly interpreted only if capnographic variations are measured.

PaO2 fell significantly from prefeeding values at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after feeds. Mean prefeeding pH and base excess values were significantly different from mean postfeeding values at 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, respectively. PaCO2 remained unchanged before and after feeding. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change throughout the study. Dynamic lung compliance, respiratory, rate, and tidal volume did not change significantly but there was a trend toward increase in tidal volume. Mean minute volume rose with time as a consequence of the increased tidal volume. Work of breathing remained unchanged at 10 and 20 minutes postfeed and increased slightly at 30 minutes; this was due to a small increase in both elastic and viscous work components at this time.\n",

A standard quantitative hyperpnea test of this type should be devised, with specification of the hypocapnia level to be achieved.\n",

      "摘要: Fifteen infants recovering from neonatal respiratory disease had arterial blood gases and lung mechanics measured 5 minutes before bolus feeds and at 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after feeding to determine physiologic effects of feeding. PaO2 fell significantly from prefeeding values at 5, 10, and 20 minutes after feeds. Mean prefeeding pH and base excess values were significantly different from mean postfeeding values at 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes, respectively. PaCO2 remained unchanged before and after feeding. Heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not change throughout the study. Dynamic lung compliance, respiratory, rate, and tidal volume did not change significantly but there was a trend toward increase in tidal volume. Mean minute volume rose with time as a consequence of the increased tidal volume. Work of breathing remained unchanged at 10 and 20 minutes postfeed and increased slightly at 30 minutes; this was due to a small increase in both elastic and viscous work components at this time.\n",

      "摘要: During general anesthesia for bronchoscopy, hypoxemia is a major risk, especially in patients with a severe intrapulmonary shunt. With the technique of apnea in pure oxygen, after one hour denitrogentation, and with an intake of 50 liters of oxygen per minute through the bronchoscope, the PaO2 was greater than 400 mm of Hg, but hypercapnia and acidosis occurred. To compensate the latter, five minute sessions of apnea, alternating with two minutes of jet hyperventilation, nevertheless, have the disadvantage of producing a Ventrui phenomena at the proximal end of the bronchoscope, hence a fall in FiO2 which was dangerous in these high risk patients. The authors propose a method so that the Venturi phenomenon, which cannot be prevented, occurs in pure oxygen.\n",

      "摘要: The methods used for ventilation of the neonate shold be based upon consideration of the physiological changes which occure in the lungs and circulation at birth of the normal infant. Three important changes must be taken into consideration. The first is the formation of a residual volume of alveolar gas, the second the resorption of pulmonary fluid and the third a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, upon which is dependent the change from foetal circulation to that of the neonate. To begin insufflation of foetal lungs it is necessary to use a pressure of between 20 and 30 cm H2O. After the first insufflation, a good deal of air remains in the lungs, even during expiration, as long as pulmonary \"surfactant\" is present. In the absence of the latter, residual pressure at the end of expiration is necessary in order to avoid the lung emptying itself of air. The resorption of pulmonary liquid from the alveolar spaces into the blood is dependent upon a change in the permeability of the alveolar epithelium, which renders possible the rapid passage of water via the channels which open, probably between the epithelial cells, and this change is dependent upon an expansion of the lungs by a pressure of between 35 and 40 cm H2O. Dilatation of the pulmonary vessels depends in part upon an increase in partial pressure of oxygen and a fall in carbon dioxide in the environment of the pulmonary arterioles, and in part upon mechanical changes brought about by the movements of ventilatation.\n",

      "摘要: 1. The mechanism by which the fluorescent, cationic dye diS-C3-(5) responds to the membrane potential of red blood cells has been investigated. 2. The dye in aqueous solution absorbs most strongly at 650 nm. Addition of white, haemoglobin-free membranes red shifts the absorption maximum ca. 20 nm, while addition of membrane-free cell lysate results in the appearance of a new dye absorption peak at 590 nm. Thus the dye binds both to cell membranes and to cell contents. The component of the cytoplasm which binds the dye is non-dialysable, presumably haemoglobin. 3. Dye added to a suspension of intact cells shows a strong absorption at 590 nm indicating that the dye has bound to the cell contents and that the membrane is permeable to the dye. 4. The amount of dye which partitions into (and on to) the cells can be determined, as reported by Sims, Waggoner, Wang &amp; Hoffman (1974), from the fluorescence of the dye remaining in the supernatant after the cells are centrifuged to the bottom of the suspension. In most conditions the proportion of the cell associated dye which is either free inside the cell or bound to the outside face of the membrane is negligible compared to the proportion bound to the cell contents. 5. On the assumption that the dye is not actively transported, the ratio of the equilibrium dye activities inside and outside the cell, ai/ao, is determined by the membrane potential according to the Nernst relation. Driving the membrane potenial negative then increases the cell associated dye by increasing the activity ratio and hence ai and the amount of dye bound to cell contents. 6. At the known Donnan equilibrium potential the internal dye activity can be calculated from the external activity. An empirical relation between cell associated dye and internal activity has been determined by measuring the dye partition between cells and medium at different external activities. 7. Using this empirial relation, and providing that any changes in cell composition do not affect the dye binding, the internal activity at any potential can be calculated from the measured amount of cell associated dye. The external activity can be estimated fluorimetrically. The membrane potential is then calculated from the activity ratio. 8. The membrane potenial of cells has been altered by adding valinomycin in the presence of different K gradients. Under the conditions used, the 'constant field' permeability for K-Val is 15-20 times that of Cl. 9. Dye binding to haemoglobin is influenced by pH and thus dye partitioning into cells changes with intracellular pH. Increasing intracellular pH increases the amount of dye partitioned, while decreasing pH decreases this amount. 10. When large potentials are produced with valinomycin there is no change in intracellular pH.

      "摘要: In the Howrah District in India, three clinics--one in each of the urban, slum, and rural areas of the city--were initiated by the Humanity Association of Howrah in November of 1968 to supply oral contraceptives (OCs) to women from 15 to 45 years of age. The project was discontinued in September, 1972. Of the 1700 patients still active when the project ended, 1527 were contacted for the follow-up survey. Findings indicate that most women in this district were satisfied with OCs and would continue to use them if they were available. In corroboration of this, it was found that 43% of the women had used OC'S obtained from other sources after the project was discontinued. While 35.5% of the women who used no contraceptive method after project ended reported becoming pregnant or suspected that they were pregnant at the time of the interview, only 4.2% of those who reported using some form of contraception reported pregnancy or suspected pregnancy. The demographic impact of the project will be evaluated on the basis of data to be obtained in a subsequent survey of the same communities.\n",

      "摘要: This study examined the accuracy rate of judging nonverbal skills used by nursing students in communicating with patients. Self-ratings of the students were compared with composite instructor ratings to find areas of disagreement regarding the quality of the nonverbal skills. Students who rated their nonverbal acuity higher than the instructors and students who rated their nonverbal acuity lower than the instructors were parceled out of the total sample of 92 senior nursing students enrolled in a baccalaureate program. Nonverbal acuity was measured by asking subjects to identify nonverbal information about emotional states from pictures. A November Picture Test consisting of 120 pictorial items was utilized as the dependent variable. Results showed that almost one half of the sample disagreed with the instructor rating applied to their nonverbal skills with patients. The differences between the groups was significant at the 0.05 level and the students were accurate in designating the direction of difference. Results are discussed in relation to clinical evaluation by both faculty and students in appraising communication skills. Implications such as grade inflation are discussed and recommendations for further study are covered.\n",

      "摘要: Intercourse between the young and the old is accompanied by difficulties in finding the right word. Authentic observations will be presented. These every-day experiences have prompted the search for the felicity conditions of verbal interaction between members of different age groups. This concern is called linguistics of ageing (or, etatolinguistics). It is called linguistic gerontology (or, gerontolinguistics) if older people are involved in the verbal interactions to be investigated. Papers from the fields of intelligence psychology, language psychology, and language sociology have indeed reported differences in verbal scores between groups of different ages. What has not been answered as yet, however, is the question whether these differences are, or may be, responsible for the difficulties arising in verbal interaction between different age groups. A review of hypotheses as to why verbal scores differ between different age groups in the way they do will reveal that this problem has not as yet been solved either. In conclusion, a programme for further research will be outlined.\n",

      "摘要: Special characteristics of cellular buffering must be taken into account in order to describe accurately acid-base relationships in the whole body. In particular, tissues other than blood are able to neutralize mineral acid independent of changes in Pco(2) and hence independent of large changes in extra- and intracellular pH. Although mechanistic details remain to be clarified, relationships that describe this tissue buffering in quantitative terms are well established. In this report, emphasis is placed on quantitative relationships that stress the need for diagnostic interpretation derived from acid-base changes within the whole body rather than simply within the blood compartment. Theoreticalproblems with respect ot buffering mechanisms in various body compartments are reviewed and analyzed.\n",

      "摘要: A self-completion sleep evaluation questionnaire (SEQ), consisting of 10 cm line analogue rating scale questions, was constructed to investigate subjects' responses to aspects of sleep and early morning behaviour. The questions were grouped into 4 chronological areas: the ease of getting to sleep (GTS), the perceived quality of sleep (QOS), the ease of awakening from sleep (AFS), and the integrity of early morning behaviour following wakefulness (BFW). Five hundred and one SEQs were completed during several investigations into the comparative effectiveness of hypnotic drugs. The classical factor analysis produced 4 factors which corresponded to the 4 aspects of sleep and early morning behaviour listed above. The GTS and QOS factors were positively correlated (+0.57), as were the AFS and BFW factors (+0.48). The 2 sleeping state factors (GTS and QOS) were orthogonal to the 2 waking state factors (AFS and BFW).\n",

The mechanism by which the fluorescent, cationic dye diS-C3-(5) responds to the membrane potential of red blood cells has been investigated. 2. The dye in aqueous solution absorbs most strongly at 650 nm. Addition of white, haemoglobin-free membranes red shifts the absorption maximum ca. 20 nm, while addition of membrane-free cell lysate results in the appearance of a new dye absorption peak at 590 nm. Thus the dye binds both to cell membranes and to cell contents. The component of the cytoplasm which binds the dye is non-dialysable, presumably haemoglobin. 3. Dye added to a suspension of intact cells shows a strong absorption at 590 nm indicating that the dye has bound to the cell contents and that the membrane is permeable to the dye. 4. The amount of dye which partitions into (and on to) the cells can be determined, as reported by Sims, Waggoner, Wang &amp; Hoffman (1974), from the fluorescence of the dye remaining in the supernatant after the cells are centrifuged to the bottom of the suspension. In most conditions the proportion of the cell associated dye which is either free inside the cell or bound to the outside face of the membrane is negligible compared to the proportion bound to the cell contents. 5. On the assumption that the dye is not actively transported, the ratio of the equilibrium dye activities inside and outside the cell, ai/ao, is determined by the membrane potential according to the Nernst relation. Driving the membrane potenial negative then increases the cell associated dye by increasing the activity ratio and hence ai and the amount of dye bound to cell contents. 6. At the known Donnan equilibrium potential the internal dye activity can be calculated from the external activity. An empirical relation between cell associated dye and internal activity has been determined by measuring the dye partition between cells and medium at different external activities. 7. Using this empirial relation, and providing that any changes in cell composition do not affect the dye binding, the internal activity at any potential can be calculated from the measured amount of cell associated dye. The external activity can be estimated fluorimetrically. The membrane potential is then calculated from the activity ratio. 8. The membrane potenial of cells has been altered by adding valinomycin in the presence of different K gradients. Under the conditions used, the 'constant field' permeability for K-Val is 15-20 times that of Cl. 9. Dye binding to haemoglobin is influenced by pH and thus dye partitioning into cells changes with intracellular pH. Increasing intracellular pH increases the amount of dye partitioned, while decreasing pH decreases this amount. 10. When large potentials are produced with valinomycin there is no change in intracellular pH. This result indicates that in red blood cells intracellular pH is determined by the external pH and the Cl concentration ratio and not by the membrane potentials. 11.

In a pH 3--10 gradient, extracts of both human and cynomolgus monkey pituitaries were each resolved into 4 growth hormone components and at least 3 prolactin components, as shown by radioimmunoassay. In narrower gradients (of 2--3 pH units) greater resolution was achieved; the principal growth hormone components were well separated from the principal prolactin components but there was overlapping of some minor components. A partially purified human prolactin preparation was found to contain 4 prolactin components, one of which had a prolactin/growth hormone ratio of 760. Clinical grade human growth hormone was also resolved into at least 5 prolactin and 5 growth hormone components, many of which had higher pI values than those found in pituitary extract. Under the conditions used, both growth hormone and prolactin were found to be polymorphic with respect to isoelectric point. Some of the human prolactin components were found to contain less than 0.2% growth hormone by radioimmunoassay. Monkey growth hormone containing 0.01% prolactin was isolated. These findings demonstrate that isoelectric focusing is useful for the preparation of both growth hormone and prolactin which are essentially free of one another. Furthermore, the polymorphic forms were repeatedly found in preparations obtained by several methods and from 2 different species, suggesting that these forms are not artifacts.', 'pmid': 'PMID:227', 'source_id': '1de0f107d901eed27352a855c914fda682c994dffdd12dd9ae2f551ddc555c92', 'page_number': 1}, score: 3.742828266695142e-05),\n",

Ten computerized methods representative of the major clustering approaches and using various measures of similarity between patients were applied to this data set to develop de novo patient groupings. Evaluative criteria included the concordance of clustering output to the structure of the original data, and clustering replicability. Considerable differences were obtained among clustering methods.
